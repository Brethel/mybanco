MyBacno
======
**MyBanco** is a core banking framework.

Firstly, let me start with: __I would love to see this project rewritten__.

This was a project that I started back in 2008 for a high school project.

I have put the version of the last download that was available 
in this repository.

Feel free to fork the code, any new additions would be more then welcome.

There is a setup guide that is kind of dated which you can see at
[a blog post here](http://timg.ws/2009/01/26/installing-mybanco-with-xampp-on-windows/)

There is quite some interest in an open source
core banking server, so if anyone would like to rewrite this codebase, you are more then welcome to it.
